- 👋 Hi, I’m @aibosslady
- 👀 I’m interested in how AI is changing politics at such a rapid pace ... and so few seem to notice
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, or trying anyway, how to increase my knowledge and skills of coding enough that I break out of the category of 'knows enough to REALLY fuck shit up'
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project bouncing around in my head, which has the potential to rock the political world and make bank, but that I do not have the skills or knowledge to bring to fruition
- 📫 How to reach me ... aibosslady@outlook.com, but best way is twitter ... @AiAndPolitics
